DZNPhotoPickerController
========================

A photo search/picker using popular providers like 500px, Flickr and many others..
This framework tries to mimic as close as possible the native UIImagePickerController API for iOS7, in terms of features, appearance and behavior.

### Features
* Search photos on mutiple service providers (Only 500px and Flickr for now)
* Present the photo picker with a pre-defined search term to automatically start searching.
* Exact same UI layouts and behaviour than UIImagePickerController.
* Edit photo selections with cropping guides (square and circular, like the Contacts app).
* Support for circular cropping mode for using with UIImagePickerController (check on UIImagePickerController+Edit).

## Installation

Available in [Cocoa Pods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=DZNPhotoPickerController)
```
pod 'DZNPhotoPickerController', '~> 1.0.7'
```

## How to use

### Step 1

```
Import "<DZNPhotoPickerController/DZNPhotoPickerController.h>" on your view controller.
```

### Step 2
Before even creating a new instance of DZNPhotoPickerController, it is recommended that you register to the photo services APIs on the +[NSObject initialize] method, like so:
```
+ (void)initialize
{
    [DZNPhotoPickerController registerForServiceType:DZNPhotoPickerControllerService500px
                                    withConsumerKey:YOUR_500px_KEY
                                  andConsumerSecret:YOUR_500px_SECRET];
    
    [DZNPhotoPickerController registerForServiceType:DZNPhotoPickerControllerServiceFlickr
                                    withConsumerKey:YOUR_Flickr_KEY
                                  andConsumerSecret:YOUR_Flickr_SECRET];
}
```

### Step 3
Instantiating a DZNPhotoPickerController is very similar to instantiate a UIImagePickerController object:
```
DZNPhotoPickerController *picker = [[DZNPhotoPickerController alloc] init];
picker.supportedServices = DZNPhotoPickerControllerService500px | DZNPhotoPickerControllerServiceFlickr;
picker.allowsEditing = YES;
picker.delegate = self;
    
[self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:NO];
````

You can additionally set more properties:
```
picker.initialSearchTerm = @"Surf";
picker.editingMode = DZNPhotoEditViewControllerCropModeCircular;
````
